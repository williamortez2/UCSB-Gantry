Each folder represents a single carrier tray. Carrier Trays should have an id number 'sharpie-d' onto them
	that matches the name of its folder. The contents are described below.

'Centers' lists the positions of the centers between each set of locating pins on the tray. Values
	are written to this file when fiducials are located on the tray by the gantry. Note that
	if the tray is released from vacuum, it will move and these coordinates will become outdated.
	In the future these coordinates may be held only temporarily in LabVIEW, but the debugging stages
	we are at now are made easier by storing these in a text file.

'Fiducials' lists the positions of the fiducials relative to the workspace that the carrier tray resides.
	They are the results of the last time the fiducials were located. Each time the tray is moved these
	coordinates are used to help the gantry move approximately to the new fiducial locations.

'OGP Coordinates' lists the positions of the fiducials and locating pins as found by the OGP. It does 
	not matter where and what angle the plate was measured on the OGP. LabVIEW accounts for this as it
	translates the coordinates to its own workspace.

'Pin Coordinates' generated programatically, used only for debugging.

'Cure Correction' documents the drift of a component during curing. This value is subtracted from the 
	position that the gantry intends to place the component.
